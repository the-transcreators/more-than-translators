There are a lot of voices out there and if you are trying to sell something you need to grab and hold a reader's attention.</p><p>We all know that.</p><p>I bet you take a lot of care to make your source language copy as good as it can. That's achievable if the source language is your own language.</p><p>What about the English translation though? Why should that be any less important? Are customers in the English-speaking world somehow magically more likely to work hard to understand bad copy than elsewhere? If anything, the opposite is true. In the English-speaking world, clarity is king. You do <em>not </em>get any points for sounding intelligent. Using simple language to explain complex things clearly is the key to success.</p><p>Are you sure that you are as sensitive to what might be wrong with with your English copy? Don't forget that sometimes an English translation might look good to you because you recognize each element from the source. BUT, those elements may be a bit strange or even completely meaningless in the English-speaking world. In fact, sometimes the translation that looks <em>best </em>to a native speaker of the source language is the <em>hardest to understand</em> for a native speaker of the target language.</p><p>How can you know what is right? Well, you might have to bite the bullet and employ an expert. Not doing so can end up to be an expensive false economy.</p><p>What now? A translator? There are lots of agencies offering to deliver the work next day at a very keen price per word. That doesn't sound too bad. Ah, but they subcontract the work for even less per word to translators somewhere in the world who are under pressure to churn out the words as fast as possible in order to make a living. How motivated do you think they are to put the appropriate amount of time, effort and care into your translation? How likely are they to take the time to work closely with you to decide on exactly the right words? How would they even contact you if they wanted to work with you? Of course, it depends on the type of job, but for your "shopfront" copy, this is not usually going to be the best strategy.</p><p>Better to find a good transcreator and deal directly with them. All you need to do is find one who charges a realistic hourly rate and is committed to producing an excellent result quickly, but not in a mad rush. English copy that will not only explain clearly, but will also persuade effectively.</p><p>That is probably easier said than done. Or is it? Have you just found two?</p><p>It might well be worth finding out by giving us a try.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://the-transcreators.github.io/more-than-translators/authors/author1/" class="invert" rel="author">Mark</a></h3><p>I am a freelance translator with over 20 years experience in translation, localization and transcreation.
