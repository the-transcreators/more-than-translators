That's a nice example of how a machine translation can be just silly. It <em>can </em>be useful sometimes though. It can help with email exchanges, or if you need to quickly translate something you're reading into your language. These are situations where everybody knows and accepts that they're going to have to work a little harder to understand what is meant, and that some things won't be immediately clear, and that some things might be completely unclear.</p><p>Using machine translation can be fun, when everybody's on board with it and willing to make an effort.</p><p>Have you noticed, however, how it is suddenly not at all fun when you are reading a piece of website text, for example, and you start to suspect that machine translation has been used for it?</p><p>In the case of English, certainly, machine translation is not good enough. Yes, I am boldly making that bold statement. If English is not the de facto lingua franca in most international commerce then I don't know what language is. How you present your company in English deserves special attention. A company needs to show that it knows how to do things properly, not necessarily for every last piece of written material, but for the main things.</p><p>If I see a bad translation into English, I always think the same thing:</p><ul><li>Are they too lazy to do the translation properly? What else are they too lazy to do properly?</li><li>Don't they think that clear communication is important? What else don't they think is important?</li><li>Don't they realize how bad the English is here? What else don't they realize is bad?</li><li>Can't they be bothered to get the English checked by a qualified expert (who is also a native speaker of English)? What else can't they be bothered to get checked by a qualified expert?</li></ul><p>What do you think when you see a bad translation into your language?</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://the-transcreators.github.io/more-than-translators/authors/author1/" class="invert" rel="author">Mark</a></h3><p>I am a freelance translator with over 20 years experience in translation, localization and transcreation.
