To set the scene, it’s Thursday evening, or even worse, Friday morning when a client sends out a text that needs to be translated by Monday. For fear of losing revenue, or even worse a client, the translator agrees to deliver the completed translation in the requested time frame. In some cases, this won’t be such a big deal as it is a small and therefore manageable job. However, all too often it’s a bigger job that warrants more time than the client realizes to deliver quality work resulting in, you guessed it, a rush job. The translator spends the weekend sweating over large volumes of text, sometimes technical in nature, with the looming deadline in mind and ends up delivering substandard or even inaccurate results simply to get the job done on time. Neither client nor translator benefit from a rush job.</p><p><strong>Why do rush jobs happen?</strong></p><p>Rush jobs usually happen when a client is busy working on several projects at a time and realizes they are behind schedule. Often, they will then complete a text as quickly as possible and send it off to the translator with a tight, and often unrealistic, deadline in order to tick off the task from their long to-do list. This often happens towards the end of the working week and in some cases the translator is left to decipher a source text that is not particularly well written or structured leading to inaccuracies as the client is not available at the weekend. </p><p><strong>What can be done to avoid rush jobs and improve quality?</strong></p><p>Some simple steps can be taken to avoid rush jobs and improve quality. Firstly, a client needs to understand the value and importance of quality localized translations, especially when it comes to print or online media. Secondly, clients need to factor in time for translations when planning new projects. This point is often completely overlooked or underestimated. Finally, clients need to involve translators more in the planning process so realistic lead times for quality translations can be agreed upon.</p><p>Contact us today to learn more about how we can help you to improve the quality of your translated texts and get ahead of your competitors!</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://the-transcreators.github.io/more-than-translators/authors/author2/" class="invert" rel="author">Warren</a></h3><p>I am a freelance translator with well over 20 years experience.
