In our globalized world, English has become a tool for communication, especially in business, science and education. Although English might not be the most spoken first language (L1), it is by far the most widely spoken second language (L2) with more than a billion speakers globally. Add these to the approximately 370 million L1 English speakers equates to more than 16% of the global population conversing in English on a regular basis.</p><p>Undoubtably such a large number of people speaking English on a regular basis leads to some L2 speakers being capable of producing translations that some L1 speakers would assume were written by a native speaker. However, on closer inspection most L1 speakers would conclude that something is not quite right, or even stilted with such translations.</p><p>This ‘something-is-not-quite-right’ feeling often pertains to many areas such as the lexis used, sentence and grammatical structure, not to mention a lack of localization and in some cases a misinterpretation of the source text, which can mislead the reader – your potential new client. If I had a Dollar for every translation I’ve come across where I’ve had this ‘something-is-not-quite-right’ feeling I’d be living a very comfortable life indeed.</p><p><strong>Why does this ‘something-is-not-quite-right’ feeling happen so often?</strong></p><p>It’s pretty simple. Most businesses have someone amongst their ranks who has a good command of the English language and can write to a reasonably high standard. This person is often then given the task of translating documents, brochures, and even the company website. Whilst this would not necessarily be an issue for standard email communication with clients, it can become a serious issue when it comes to print and online media leading to misunderstandings, a lack of localization and ultimately giving your media an unprofessional feel to it.</p><p><strong>What can I do to make sure my copy does not have that ‘something-is-not-quite-right’ feeling?</strong></p><p>In a nutshell, use a transcreator. A well transcreated piece of copy will eliminate that ‘something-is-not-quite-right’ feeling and evoke the emotions necessary for a reader to buy in to your message. A transcreator guarantees your copy will be clear of misinterpretation and misunderstanding and is localized to your target market.</p><p>What are you waiting for? Get peace of mind and get rid of that ‘something-is-not-quite-right’ feeling today!</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://the-transcreators.github.io/more-than-translators/authors/author2/" class="invert" rel="author">Author2</a></h3><p>I am a freelance translator with well over 20 years experience.
