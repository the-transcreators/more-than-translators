So can the reader. What's different about transrcreation? What exactly is it? Why is a transcreated message clearer, and more powerful?</p><p>Transcreation uses imagery that resonates in the minds of the target readership. Localization copyrighting is another, possibly more self-explanatory term for transcreation. Call it what you like, it involves a whole extra level of creative input. It is the process of <em>rewriting </em>a piece of text in another language. Translation on the other hand tends to stay fairly close to the words of the source text.</p><p>A well transcreated piece of copy might on the face of it seem to have nothing at all to do with the source. But it will have the same effect on the readership. And evoke the emotions (culturally adjusted) necessary for them to buy in to your message.</p><p>Can anybody with good knowledge of both languages do it? No. You need much more than that. Even truly bilingual people (that is people who have been immersed in two languages from birth and effectively have two mother tongues) would struggle to sufficiently distance themselves from the source. Even regular straightforward translation is astonishingly difficult for those who have not spent a long time practicing.</p><p><strong>Transcreators need all of these things</strong></p><ul><li><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">To be native speakers of the target language</span></li><li>A lot of experience doing real commercial translations</li><li>A genuine fascination for language and the art of transcreation</li><li>The motivation and determination to go the extra mile</li><li>Creativity and a well-developed ability to think laterally</li><li>The confidence to be able to reject their own ideas</li><li>The confidence to be able toÂ  reject the client's own ideas</li><li>To NOT be under unrealistic time or economic pressure</li></ul><p>Notice that confidence plays a big part. If anything, it is a bit downplayed in that list. It is, however, absolutely essential. But it must be well-founded. It must be based on experience and knowledge and not on exuberant overconfidence, and certainly NOTHING TO DO with any kind of fake-it-till-you-make-it nonsense.</p><p>I have the confidence and the knowledge, it has taken many, many years and thousands of hours of brain-racking and almost obsessive application to bulid up (all under control, don't worry I'm not a weirdo).</p><p>Get in touch and give me any kind of transcreation test you like.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://the-transcreators.github.io/more-than-translators/authors/author1/" class="invert" rel="author">Mark</a></h3><p>I am a freelance translator with over 20 years experience in translation, localization and transcreation.
